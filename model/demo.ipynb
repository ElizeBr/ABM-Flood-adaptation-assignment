    "This python script outlines a basic Agent-Based Model (ABM) developed using the Mesa framework, designed as a simplified representation of household adaptation to flood events in a social network context. The model serves as a template for understanding the fundamental mechanics of flood adapdtation with a given social network.\n",
    "\n",
    "This directory is structured as follows:\n",
    " - A Mesa Agent class `Households` is defined in `agents.py`\n",
    " - A Mesa Agent class `Government` is defined in `agents.py` (this agent currently does not perform any action)\n",
    " - A Mesa Model class `AdaptationModel` is defined in `model.py`\n",
    " - This notebook `demo.ipynb` provides a demonstration of the model and its visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each household agent in the model represents a household with attributes and behaviors that determine its response to flood events. The flood depth attribute assigned to each household is currently random for demonstration purposes. The decision by each household to adapt is also arbitrary. In a more comprehensive model, this could be replaced with more sophisticated decision-making algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current implementation includes several simplifications and arbitrary choices, such as random flood depths and basic adaptation logic based on random thresholds. These aspects are designed for clarity and ease of understanding and should be replaced with realistic and sound choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to modify, expand, and customize the model. This might include integrating real-world data, implementing more complex decision-making processes for agents, or exploring different network topologies and their effects on social dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visualisation provided is basic. Additional aspects can be added for visualization and more in-depth analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "_This notebook was tested on 2023-11-13 with Mesa version 2.1.4 on Python 3.12.0._"
